 JASmine, print accounting for Cups
     (c) Nayco
====================================

This is JASmine version 0.0.3. This code is in early
developpement state, so do not expect for miracles !

However, it already accounts prints jobs and stores
the results to a MySQL database, and displays simple
reports on a web page; but sometimes these results 
may not be accurate, so do not use these reports
for print billing !!!
