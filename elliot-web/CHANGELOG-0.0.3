* 10-01-2006
  - Cleaned again the stylesheets, the menus are better.

* 19-01-2006
  - Menus, CSS stylesheet, again... Oh, I'll have to re-work
    the IE stylesheet too...

    show_printer.php. Now, nice messages are displayed in

    "error_block" div.

    libs (they are now called "terreau")
*  25-06-2006

    without being escaped !
* 01-10-2006

    docs, scripts... Fixed typos.
