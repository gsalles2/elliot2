Elliot Installation

This is the installation procedure for elliot-Web. More
information and (Maybe ;-)) user feedback can be found at
English documentation is there too.


1- Put the content of all this archive in a directory under
   the DocumentRoot of your web server. Example:
   # cd /var/www/html/
   # tar xvjf /path/to/elliot-Web-x.y.z.tar.bz2
   # mv elliot-Web elliot
   # cd elliot
   Take care of the files and dirs permissions !!!
2- Copy config.php.dist to config.php, and edit this file
   to reflect your MySQL server setup. Example:
   # cp config.php.dist config.php
   # vi config.php
   # cat config.php
   $DB_host="mysql.here.com";
   $DB_login="elliot";
   $DB_pass="sql_password";
   $DB_db="print"
3- Point your favorite browser to
   http://your-web.server/elliot, and enjoy !

That's all !
