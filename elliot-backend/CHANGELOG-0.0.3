Changelog for JASmine-Backend-0.0.3

* 17-01-2006
  - Modified the logging functions so that their output is displayed
    in Cups's web interface (In the "Manage printers" section).
* 27-03-2006
  - Restored (Well, Uncommented) the code that forces the value of
    the URI environment variable before lauching the real backend :
    It seems the 'smb' backend had problems with it not set to the
    right value.
* 10-07-2006
  - Added SQL escaping on the values to be inserted in the database. I
    can't believe I forgot this :-O !
  - Improved MySQL insert error reporting.
  - I did all the above modifications on an old version of the
    file. Pleasures of conflict resolution with "diff" and "patch"
    are going to be mine :-(.
* 27-08-2006
  - Finally resolved the version conflict.
* 08-09-2006
  - Made a few changes in INSTALL, changed default passwords in the
    'jasmine' script
* 09-09-2006
  - Pkpgcounter upgraded from 1.82 to 1.85
  - Tested JASmine-Backend with Cups 1.2.3 : Everything is fine.
  - Now pkpgcounter is provided as a tar.gz archive, not a directory.
* 15-09-2006
  - Reworked debug modes, added developer mode.
  - Improved count failure processing. JASmine-Backend no longer records
    '-1' to the database (thus making print stats false), but '0'.
  - Cosmetic changes, added comments.
* 01-10-2006
  - Preparing for realease : Reviewed copyright notices, READMEs,
    docs, scripts...
