=============================================================================

pkpgcounter News :

  * 2.10 :
  
    - Added a plain text parser, with support for both page counting and
      ink coverage.
    
    - Added a minimal SPL1 parser.
    
    - Fixed a problem in the PCLXL parser related to Kyocera printer drivers.
    
  * 2.00 :
  
    - The PCL3/4/5 parser was rewritten from scratch and is now
      table driven.
      
    - Improved the PostScript parser.
    
  * 1.85 :
  
    - Added support for Samsung QPDL (aka SPL2) file format in page
      counting mode, thanks to the work done by Aurélien Croc on
      reverse engineering the file format.
      
  * 1.85alpha :
  
    - Added test document and program to generate the test document
      to check the functionning of the ink coverage computation algorithm.
      
  * 1.84 :
  
    - Computation of ink coverage now works and is documented.
      The supported file formats are : PS, PDF, PCLXL, PCL3/4/5,
      DVI and TIFF.
      
  * 1.84alpha :
  
    - Added initial support for the computation of ink coverage.
      See python analyzer.py --help for details. The same command
      line options work for pkpgcounter, although it's not
      documented yet.
    
  * 1.83 :
  
    - Fixed a famously known 'brown paper bag' issue with file type autodetection. 
    
  * 1.82 :
  
    - Fixed PCL3/4/5 parser to detect recent Xerox drivers' output. 
    
  * 1.81 :
  
    - Improved the gs+Acrobat Reader fix done in 1.78.
    
  * 1.80 :
  
    - Added support for Zenographics ZjStream input format.
    
  * 1.79 :
  
    - Fixed a small problem in PostScript parser with dvips output.
    
  * 1.78 :
  
    - Launches gs less often when printing is done from Acrobat
      Reader.
    
  * 1.77 : 
  
    - Fixed some problems with the code introduced in 1.76.
    
    - Improved PCLXL parser's speed by almost 10%.
    
  * 1.76 :
  
    - Improved the PCLXL parser wrt undocumented tags.
    
    - Preliminary support for Kyocera Prescribe commands.
    
  * 1.75 :
  
    - Added preliminary support for Canon ImageRunner's "LIPS" or "UFR"
      (I don't know which) Page Description Language. 
      
  * 1.74 :
  
    - Fixed a problem in the retrieval of named media sizes in PCLXL.
    
    - Changed copyright years.
    
  * 1.73 :
  
    - Fixed duplex detection code in PCL3/4/5 parser.
    
    - Fixed PCLXL detection code.
    
    - Fixed retrieval of custom media types' names in PCLXL.
    
    - Added inactive code to compute ink coverage ala PrintBill.
    
  * 1.72 :
  
    - Improved heuristic to detect when ghostscript has to be used to do
      the parsing.
   
  * 1.71 :
  
    - Now uses ghostscript as the parser when the PS stream was created by a
      particular MSWindows driver.
    
    - Only complains about Psyco missing at install time, and stays
      quiet when running without Psyco.
      
  * 1.70 :
  
    - Fixed some PJL escaping issue in the PCLXL and PCL3/4/5 parsers.
