============================================================

The following people helped the pkpgcounter project :
  
  
  - Eduardo Gielamo Oliveira & Rodolfo Broco Manin : initial PCL parser.
  
  - Valcir C. Vargas : helped on PCL3GUI support.
  
  - Daniel Franklin : pkpgcounter's algorithm for the computation 
    of ink coverage comes from Daniel's PrintBill project.
    
  - Aurélien Croc : reverse engineered Samsung QPDL and published  
                    a language specification.

  - Franck (?) : sent a path to improve the PostScript parser when
                 the PS code generated several copies.
