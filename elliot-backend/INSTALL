Intalling JASmine-Backend

This is the installation procedure for JASmine-Backend. More
information and (Maybe ;-)) user feedback can be found at
  http://jasmine.berlios.de/
English documentation is there too.


Ok, go on:

* Pkpgcounter installation

  The files are located in the 'pkpgcounter-VERSION' tarball.
  Pkpgcounter is part of the 'PyKota' print accounting project,
  much more advanced than mine, and is developped by Jerome
  Alet.
  Warning : Python and Perl are needed !

  1- Install Python and the Python Imaging Library (PIL).
     For example, with Mandriva :
     # urpmi python python-imaging

  2- Pkpgcounter installation
    You can use pkpgcounter's installer (Recommended, but you will
    need python-devel with some distros - Mandriva, for example),
    or do it manually :

    * Manual installation : All you need it to copy pkpgcounter and its
      libraries to the right place; X.X is your Python version (Python2.4 on
      Mandriva 2006.0)
      # tar xfzv pkpgcounter-VERSION.tar.gz
      # cd pkpgcounter-VERSION
      # cp -r pkpgpdls /usr/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages/
      # cp bin/pkpgcounter /usr/bin

      Take care of the owner and permissions !!!

    * Using the installer :
      # tar xfzv pkpgcounter-VERSION.tar.gz
      # cd pkpgcounter-VERSION
      # urpmi python-devel (or apt-get... Do this only if "python setup..." fails)
      # python setup.py install

* Backend installation

  1-  Copy the perl script 'jasmine' into Cups's backend directory
     (Usually '/usr/lib/cups/backend', like in Mandriva and Ubuntu),
     and chown it '755' to 'root'.

  2-  You can too copy the 'dummy' shell script there, setting the
     same permissions; it will appear in Cups' dropdown list when
     setting up a new printer as "Really virtual printer for testing
     Cups". It prints nothing, but can be used to try/debug JASmine
     without consuming paper, and it logs useful informations to syslog.
     Do not forget to chown it '755' to 'root'.

  2-  Check that you have Perl installed (by default in Mandriva
     and Ubuntu), and that the perl executable is located at
     '/usr/bin/perl'.

  4-  You'll need the DBI and MySQL perl modules installed (
     'urpmi perl-DBI perl-DBD-mysql' with Mandriva 2006.0, and 'sudo
     apt-get install libdbd-mysql-perl' with Ubuntu 5.04)

  5-  Do not forget to run the sql script into your MySQL server ! See
     the INSTALL file in the 'JASmine-MySQL' archive.

  6-  Modify the JASmine backend by editing the variables at the
     beginning of the file: Make the variables point to the right paths,
     specify the MySQL password, login, host and database, and weather
     or not you want syslog and debug messages.
     --
     my $DBhost="mysql.here.com";
     my $DBlogin="jasmine";
     my $DBpassword="sql_passowrd";
     my $DBdatabase="print";

     my $Want_Sys_Syslog=1;
     my $Debug_Mode=1;

     my $path_to_pkpgcounter="/usr/bin/pkpgcounter";
     my $path_to_python="/usr/bin/python";
     --

     You should leave $Debug_Mode to 1 and tail -f your /var/log/syslog
     file(s) while in installation/setup phase. when sure your jobs
     get accounted for, set $Debug_Mode to 0 !

  7-  Reload Cups, connect to 'http://cups_server:631', use this inteface
     to setup a new printer. Be sure to choose '....(Quota managed)' for
     the driver (URI beginning with 'jasmine:') !

     Final URIs should look like "jasmine:socket://printer_adress:9100"
     (For an HP DirectJet network printer), "jasmine:usb:/dev/usb/lp0"
     (for an USB printer... In fact, add 'jasmine:' at the beginning
     of any printer URI to make its jobs accounted.

     Then print something on this printer and look at the 'jobs_log'
     table in the database to see if the number of pages is logged...
     Do not forget to check Cups's logs and your syslog to find about
     errors.

  8-  Install 'JASmine-Web', and play with it ;-).

That's all !
